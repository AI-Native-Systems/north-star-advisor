## Document Purpose

This document translates strategy into **concrete next steps**. It answers:

1. What should we focus on in the next 30 days?
2. What should we avoid in the next 30 days?
3. What does the 90-day horizon look like?
4. How do we know we're on track?

**Decision Rule**: Every action must trace back to the North Star metric or a validated strategic move. If it doesn't, it doesn't make the roadmap.

**On [Specific Date]**, conduct phase gate review:

- [ ] Did we hit phase success criteria?
