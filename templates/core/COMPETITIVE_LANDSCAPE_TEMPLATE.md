## Document Purpose

This document maps the competitive terrain and identifies **where [PROJECT NAME] can build ahead of the market**. It answers:

1. Who are we competing against (directly and indirectly)?
2. What market shifts create opportunity?
3. Where is the whitespace for differentiation?
4. What forward-looking features should we build before competitors see them?
5. What moves should we make before others see them?

**Decision Rule**: If a strategic path doesn't leverage our differentiation or exploit a market shift, deprioritize it.
