Different audiences need different framings:

| [Audience 1] | "[How they describe it]" |
| [Audience 2] | "[How they describe it]" |
| [Audience 3] | "[How they describe it]" |
| [Audience 4] | "[How they describe it]" |
| [Audience 5] | "[How they describe it]" |

### Addressing Skepticism

Users may encounter skepticism about [your domain]. Provide language that reframes:

| Skepticism | Reframe |
|------------|---------|
| "[Common objection 1]" | "[Reframe response]" |
| "[Common objection 2]" | "[Reframe response]" |
| "[Common objection 3]" | "[Reframe response]" |

### Brand Voice in Social Context

When users share or discuss [PROJECT NAME] publicly:

**Do:**
- [Social context principle 1]
- [Social context principle 2]
- [Social context principle 3]
- [Social context principle 4]

**Don't:**
- [Social context anti-pattern 1]
- [Social context anti-pattern 2]
- [Social context anti-pattern 3]

### Social Proof Strategy

- [What we highlight 1]
- [What we highlight 2]
- [What we highlight 3]
- [What we highlight 4]

[Explanation of why standard licenses are insufficient for your domain]

**The license explicitly prohibits:**
- [Prohibited use 1]
- [Prohibited use 2]
- [Prohibited use 3]
- [Prohibited use 4]

**The license requires:**
