## Document Purpose

This document distills everything into a **single, well-reasoned recommendation**. It answers:

1. What is our situation?
2. What strategic paths are available?
3. What are the trade-offs of each path?
4. What is our recommended path — and why?
5. What should we focus on, avoid, and do next?

**This is the synthesis layer** — where analysis becomes decision.

- [ ] At least 2 strategic paths with trade-offs
- [ ] Explicit recommendation with reasoning (not just "Path A is best")
- [ ] Focus areas trace to North Star metric
- [ ] Avoid list aligns with kill lists and non-goals
- [ ] Next steps have owners and timelines
- [ ] Confidence assessment is honest (not all "High")
- [ ] Review triggers are specific and measurable
